# Project 2 - Mystic Ally's Tarot Reading
## Overview
This was the second project as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. This was a partner project which lasted 48 hours. We chose to create a tarot reading website.

## Brief
The brief was to create a react app using a public API over 48 hours.
### Technical Requirements
* Use React.js
* Consume a public API
* Have several Components
* Use Bulma as a CSS framework

### Installation
* Access the source code via the 'Clone or download' button
* Run ```npm i``` or ```npm install``` to install dependencies
* Run ```npm run dev``` to start the development server

## Built With
* HTML
* Bulma
* React.js
* Axios
* React-Router-Dom
* Git
* GitHub
* Netlify
* [Tarot Card API](https://rws-cards-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/cards/)

## Key Features
### Minimum Requirements
* Being able to get a standard 3-card spread tarot reading
* Viewing all the available tarot cards and what they mean
### Stretch Goals
* Having a 'card of the day' which would randomly generate a card every day
* Creating a home page with a component sourced online

## Planning
### Choosing an API and Planning
We spent the first few hours of the project finding an API to use and planning our React app. After browsing a few public APIs we settled on a Tarot Card API to create an app that would provide a tarot reading for the user. We did some research on different card spreads and decided to do a simple 3-card spread due to the time constraints of the project.

Once we settled on an API, we panned the project using an Excalidraw:
